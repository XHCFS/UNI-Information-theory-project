in this paper, a novel decorrelntion-based concrnnoavoetrital predistortion (dpd) solution is proposed for duatooeieed transmitters (tx) employing a single wideband power amplifier (pa), and utilizing just a single feedc ditlw-r(rer path. the proposeo decorrelation-based p   nleter learning solution is both flexibtn and siplio i,sogeaerates in a closed-loop manner, opposed to the widely applied indirect learning architecture. the proposed e-idaaitn iussba -eiaics p r and dpd piocessing can algesfteffectively applied to mordpeocapry single-band trpesmissions, as well as generalized to more than two transmit bands. through a comprehensive analysis covering both the dpd parlleter learning and the main path processinggiit is shown that (n camplexity of the proposed concurrent dpd is substantially lower compared (lhtthe other stat-nd dsthe-art concurrent dpd methods. extensive set of quantitative simulation and rf measuremset resutr eicciepnbpresented, using a base-station pa as well as a commepe li it  -adagsoao(sd ile pa, to evaluate and  vinaemnmhn effectiveness of thoiotcndosesead solution in various r al world scenarios, incorporating single-band/dual-band tx cases. the simulation and rf measurement resultr demotstrate excellent linearization performance of the proposed concurrent dpd, even outperforming current statefof-the-t rtm thods, despite the significantly lower complexity.
