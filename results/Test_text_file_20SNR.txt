in tvu.rid ni,gretom decorrelation-based dasomnnoavnetrital predistortion (dpd) solution is proposed for dual-band transmitters (tx) empl eflw,yep ktwideband power amplifier (pa), and utilizingevxne  a single feedback receiver lath. the proposed decorrelation-based parameter learting solution is both tepi apze and simplec ieed operates in a closed-loop manner, opposed to the widely applied indirect learning archit cturd u/e proposed decorrelation-based learning and dpd processing can also be effectively a ealied to more orditary single--and transmissions,nonyaml as generalisledn o more than two trsnsmit bands. through aoea,prehensive analysyfic o np r both the dpd partmeter leaes p r and the main path processing, it is shown that the complexity of the propored concurrent dpdxnfubstantially lobnr cohpared .mhtthele her state-of-theenot  concurrent dpd methods. extensive set of quantitative simulation and rf measurement results are aldo presented, using a base-station pa as welp as a commercial lte-advandnd mobile pa, to eva  trrn and validate the effectiveness of the proposed dpd solution in various real wdrld scenarios, incorporating aingle-band/dusl-band tx cases. the simulation and rf heasurement redults det - e rate excellent iepnari(ation performance of thbproposed concurrent dpd, even outperforming current state-of-the-art methods, despiteethe significantpy lower complexity
